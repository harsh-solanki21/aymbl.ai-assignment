> ## Question 2
> Assume you have an endpoint that returns a JSON output
 when a GET request is performed and write a code snippet in 
Javascript that performs a GET request to the `/get-data` endpoint and loops
through the JSON output from `data.json`. Print the `name` and `id` fields, sorting by
the `id` field.


> ## Question 3
> Integrate the code from Question 1 into a ReactJS application and display the `id`
and `name` field on the page as HTML. Use CSS to make it look nice. Upload code to
Github.
